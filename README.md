An Open-Source tool for working with lighthouse-based tracking data, including support for the HTC Vive, which is still in the experimental phase.

Most of the development is discussed on Discord.  Join the chat and discussion here: https://discordapp.com/invite/7QbCAGS

## Getting things working

There are two things you should consider doing to your system before running libsurvive.

(1) Install the udev rules:  ```cp usefulfiles/81-vive.rules to /etc/udev/rules.d/``` and reboot.
(2) If you are running on an NVIDIA Card, you will need to AllowHMD to true.  Add the following line to your /etc/X11/xorg.conf device section:  ```Option "AllowHMD" "yes"```

## Introduction
High-performance HTC Vive Library

I say "high-performance" really this project is based tightly off of OSVR-Vive-Libre, but, specifically is an attempt to:

1. Minimize external libraries.  Actual reason for starting this: Downloading all of the libraries needed for OSVR-Vive-Libre maxed out my data plan.
2. Put it under an open-source instead of a force-source license.  (GPL to MIT/X11)
3. Write it in C.
4. Avoid extra layers where convenient.
5. (long shot) Make the vive viable for use with Intel Integrated Graphics systems. [It works with HD4000 using DisplayPort. See "Intel Integrated Graphics" section below.]

Will ~~I~~ we succeed?  Probably not.  ~~Definitely going to try!~~ Though it's looking like we might.


## External dependencies

* libUSB (Linux) or hidapi (Win, OSX; included in redist)
* pthread
* libX11 (Linux) or Native (win32) or OpenGL (OSX)
* zlib (Linux) or puff.c (win32, included in redist)

## Architecture

<TD WIDTH=50%>

### Layout

In the src/ folder you'll find most of the internal code that is part of libsurvive.  The redist/ folder contains code that libsurvive uses that was copied from other projects.  Libsurvive links to other libraries, but very few.  You'll find that most of the functionality lies within libsurvive or in the redist folder.  For the user-facing headers you can find them in the include/ folder.

### Logical Data Flow

There are device drivers, such as survive_vive.c which connect to physical devices, via libUSB, hidapi or another method and collect raw IMU and lightcap data.  Lightcap data is specically a sensor ID, light pulse length (in ticks) and the time of the light pulse (in ticks).  The driver also must provide locations of the sensors to populate the SurviveObject structures of whatever sensors that driver is responsible for.

Once this data is collected, the light pulses are disambiguated (see survive_data.c) into OOTX sync pulses (id -1, -2 depending on lighthouse) as well as sweep pulses which provide the time of a sweep pulse passing the sensor.  This is passed off to "lightproc."  The default behavior for lightproc can be found in survive.c.  The user may override this, however, if they have interest in the raw pulse information for whatever reason.  The default behavior for lightproc determines the time delta between the sync pulse and the sweep pulse time and derives angle.  The derivation for the angle is simply calculated by the time difference between the sync pulse and the sweep pulse.   It then calls "angleproc"  (not implemented yet: Using OOTX data from lighthouses to correct and tweak angles)

Angleproc may also be overridden by the user for similar purposes to for "angleproc" which passes its information off to a calibrator (if running) as well as to whatever posers are enabled.  The posers will take this data and determine position from it.

## Intel Integrated Graphics

The limiting factor for Vive viability on a given computer is the maximum available pixel clock frequency, and frequency limitations of the HDMI port, and HDMI and DisplayPort video cables. DisplayPort can support higher frequencies than HDMI, on Ivy Bridge HD4000 graphics. In fact, the Vive works with HD4000 graphics using DisplayPort, with native EDID resolution (2160x1200@90Hz).

To support the Vive on HDMI, you either need a newer version of HDMI, or you need to define a custom resolution that respects pixel clock and video port limits, and is also accepted and displayed by the Vive. So far, we have not had success using custom resolutions on linux or on Windows. Windows imposes additional limitations in the form of restriction of WHQL certified drivers forbidden from using custom display resolutions (only allowing those defined by EDID in the monitor). Intel has released uncertified beta drivers for Haswell and newer processors, which should be able to support custom resolutions for the Vive (untested at this time).



## Addendum and notes

Thanks to Mr. Fault for our logo!
Special thanks to @nairol for an extreme amount of detail in reverse engineering the existing HTC Vive system on his https://github.com/nairol/LighthouseRedox project.
